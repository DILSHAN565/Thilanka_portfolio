## Automated Noise Controller for Television ðŸŽ¶ðŸ“º

### Project Overview

This project, completed as part of the Sensors and Transducers module, involved creating an Automated Noise Controller device for television. The system automatically adjusts the TV volume based on the ambient noise level, enhancing the viewing experience by preventing sudden loud or quiet moments. Users can set a desired sound threshold using a potentiometer, allowing for personalized volume control.

### Key Features

- **Dynamic Volume Adjustment**: The system automatically adjusts the TV volume when ambient noise levels exceed or fall below the user-set threshold.
- **User-Controlled Threshold**: Users can adjust the desired sound threshold level using a potentiometer, providing a customizable experience.
- **Directional Sound Sensing**: Equipped with three sound sensors positioned to capture ambient noise from different directions, ensuring accurate noise level detection.
- **Visual Feedback**: An LCD display shows real-time sound levels and system status, aiding in easy monitoring and adjustments.

### Technical Specifications

- **Microcontroller**: Arduino Uno
- **Components**: Three sound sensors, IR transmitter, IR receiver, 1602 LCD display, potentiometer
- **Programming**: Developed using Arduino IDE with C/C++
- **Functionality**: Uses IR communication to interface with the TV, adjusting volume based on detected sound levels

### Project Outcome

The project successfully demonstrated a working model that dynamically adjusts TV volume in response to ambient noise. The sound level is measured by three sensors positioned to capture noise from multiple directions, providing a robust solution for noise-sensitive environments. My primary contribution was developing the Arduino code that drives the system.

### Team & Acknowledgements
