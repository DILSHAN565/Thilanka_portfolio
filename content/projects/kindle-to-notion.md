## Description
An app built to sync book highlights taken on **Kindle** E-Reader to **Notion**, my productivity management app of choice. The highlights are exported to a text file by Kindle, which is parsed by the app using **RegEx** to be sent to Notion. The app is written in **TypeScript** and involves interfacing with **Notion API** to perform **CRUD** operations on Notion Database. The app also features caching to prevent resyncing of old highlights.
