## RFID Door Lock System using Atmega 2560 Microcontroller ðŸŒŸ

### Project Overview

Developed an advanced RFID-based door lock system leveraging the Atmega 2560 microcontroller to enhance security and convenience. The system eliminates the need for physical keys or passwords, enabling authorized access through RFID tags.

### Key Features

- **User Authentication**: Authorized access control using RFID tags, with visual (LED) and auditory (buzzer) indicators for access attempts.
- **Convenience**: Fast and secure entry with a simple RFID scan, reducing the risks associated with lost or broken keys.
- **Scalability**: Easily expandable to manage a large number of users and access privileges.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Reduces the need for physical lock replacements and maintenance.

### Technical Specifications

- **Microcontroller**: Atmega 2560
- **Components**: RFID tags and scanner, 16x2 LCD display, SG90 servo motor, LEDs, buzzer
- **Simulation and Development**: Initial design and simulation using Proteus before hardware implementation

### Project Outcome

Successfully implemented door locking/unlocking functionality via RFID for external access and a push-button for internal access. Future enhancements planned to include dynamic user management and integration with an external SQL database for better user data management.
